# Temperature-and-Humidity-Sensor-Comparisons

The purpose of this software is to compare 6 temperature and humidity sensors for relative accuracy, the comparision was of
the following device:
1. Si7051 with a factory trimmed accuracy of +/-0.1°C
2. MCP9808 with a factory trimmed accuracy of +/-0.25°C
3. SHT31D with a temperature accuracy of +/-0.3°C and humidity +/-2%
4. DHT22 with a temperature accuracy of +/-0.5°C and humidity +/-2%
5. BME280 with a temperature accuracy of +/-0.5°C and for humidity +/-3%
6. DS18B20 with a temperature accuracy of +/-0.5°C

Overall the Bosch BME280 and SHT31-D devices gave the best overall relative accuracy, but on balance the SHT31D is my preferred device.
